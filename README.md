This project serves as an automated counter, functioning without human input, where numbers are conveyed on a seven-segment display. Once powered by a battery, the digital circuit continuously cycles through the digits 0 to 9—with digit changes occurring at a rate of approximately 1 second. Upon reaching 10, the counter resets to 0, commencing a new count.
